Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of your users' bandwidth as possible. 

Pagefind runs after any static site generator and automatically indexes the built static files. Pagefind then outputs a static search bundle to your website, and exposes a JavaScript API that can be used anywhere on your site.
