Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of your users' bandwidth as possible, and without hosting any infrastructure.

Pagefind runs after any static site generator and automatically indexes the built static files. Pagefind then outputs a static search bundle to your website, and exposes a JavaScript search API that can be used anywhere on your site, or a prebuilt UI that can be used with no configuration (you can see the prebuilt UI at the top of this page). The search index is sharded, so that searching in the browser only ever needs to load a small subset of the search index.

Pagefind aims to index a site quickly, and with as little configuration as possible â€” in most cases no configuration is needed to get started. Additionally, websites with tens of thousands of pages should be searchable by someone in their browser, while consuming a reasonable amount of bandwidth. Pagefind can run a full-text search on a 10,000 page site with a total network payload under 300KB, including the Pagefind library itself. For most sites, this will be closer to 100KB.
