# Pagefind Modular UI

> The Pagefind Modular UI is under development â€” check back soon!

Pagefind is a fully static search library that aims to perform well on large sites, while using as little of your users' bandwidth as possible. 

Pagefind runs after any static site generator and automatically indexes the built static files. Pagefind then outputs a static search bundle to your website, and exposes a JavaScript search API that can be used anywhere on your site.

See the [Pagefind Documentation](https://pagefind.app/) for full usage.
